# Snapchat Notification Manager

Snapchat Notification implementation could be better since they fill up your notification drawer. There's no way to mute multiple people at once, and if you want to be notified for snaps sent by only a special few, this app comes to your rescue.

Using SnapNotif Manager, you can add people to the whitelist and get Snapchat Notifications only from those people. Isn't it great?! :sunglasses:

This app was developed while reviewing the Snapchat App for a course project (CS798H - Human-Computer Interaction).
